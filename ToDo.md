1/19 - 1/20

- Spent a lot of time researching different popover components from different component libraries trying to find one that would allow me to put buttons inside and a custom component as the trigger. Also tried to create my own component with the native popover API but I couldn't get the popover to be right below each puzzle piece. So instead I used the devtools to figure out how it was done on powerpoint, which is where I got inspiration for the popover in the first place. I found that they used their own component library called Fluent UI so I was able to use that as well.

1/21/2025

1/23/2025

- add another level ‚úÖ
- Implement a global variable for the sizeOfEachPiece dependent on the board size and screen size (only based on board size so far) ‚úÖ
- Reorganized some of the App.jsx file into smaller components like DragAndDropArea ‚úÖ
- Add tooltips to the action buttons ‚úÖ

1/24/2025

- Refactored by moving actionsToolbarPopover into a separate component ‚úÖ

1/27/2025

- Adjusted CSS to show full borders for any level dynamically ‚úÖ

1/28/2025

- Added unit tests to test each level and make sure its written correctly in the JSON file. ‚úÖ

2/1/2025 - 2/6/2025

- Converting the project to typescript. ‚úÖ Attempting to fix the alignment issue. ‚ùå

2/10/2025 - 2/16/2025

- Converting the CSS to styled components and fixing the alignment issue. ‚úÖ

Goals for 2/17 - 2/22

- Limit the pieces to fall within the bounds of the game board ‚úÖ
- Handle UX for a piece that is too tall or too long to fit on the board
- Detect and prevent collisions between pieces.

In General

- Deselect puzzle pieces on clickAway with a custom hook
- Perfect snapping to the grid when moving from outside the grid
- Perfect alignment with the grid with rotated shapes
- Make rotations always go clockwise
- Make the bounds of the game board the bounds of where you can move the pieces
- Make it impossible to put pieces on top of each other
- Add animations to reset function
- Implement piece rotations
- Implement a global variable for the sizeOfEachPiece dependent on the board size and screen size
- Hold a variable that keeps track of if the shape was just rotated to determine the transition time for the animation
- Add distributive property functionality
- Set up system to allow for fractional side lengths
- Add limits to the UI to show how many actions the user can use
- Add limits to the level json and import them through context

Bugs to Fix

- When moving a piece with the spacebar and keyboard, and then pressing reset game, that piece stays on the board.

Things to Figure Out

- Why does the puzzle piece rotate/rerender so much when I drag it?
- Can I prevent the re-rotating somehow?
- How can I rotate a piece one time and then leave it rotated across multiple components acting as one?
- How should I implement the UI for distributive property operations?
- Is it okay to have PiecesInPlay context derived from CurrentLevelContext?
- Is it okay to have 3 different components all acting as puzzlePieces?
- How to make the initialPieces container a nice UX for when moving pieces into and out of it and changing the size of pieces? Let them constantly shift or allow overlap??
- Why do the pieces animate into place when switching from level 1 to level 2 but not any other levels?

2/17

- Figure out why isDragging is not causing the cursor to change to 'grab' in InitialPuzzlePiece and PieceOnBoard
- Fix some of the typescript errors
- Understand this error from the console: hook.js:608 Warning: Cannot update a component (`PiecesInPlayProvider`) while rendering a different component (`App`). To locate the bad setState() call inside `App`, follow the stack trace as described in https://reactjs.org/link/setstate-in-render Error Component Stack at App (App.tsx:21:5) at SelectedPieceProvider (SelectedPiece.tsx:14:34) at PiecesInPlayProvider (PiecesInPlay.tsx:13:33) at CurrentLevelProvider (CurrentLevel.tsx:30:33)
