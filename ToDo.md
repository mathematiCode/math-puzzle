1/19 - 1/20

- Spent a lot of time researching different popover components from different component libraries trying to find one that would allow me to put buttons inside and a custom component as the trigger. Also tried to create my own component with the native popover API but I couldn't get the popover to be right below each puzzle piece. So instead I used the devtools to figure out how it was done on powerpoint, which is where I got inspiration for the popover in the first place. I found that they used their own component library called Fluent UI so I was able to use that as well.

1/21/2025

1/23/2025

- add another level ‚úÖ
- Implement a global variable for the sizeOfEachPiece dependent on the board size and screen size (only based on board size so far) ‚úÖ
- Reorganized some of the App.jsx file into smaller components like DragAndDropArea ‚úÖ
- Add tooltips to the action buttons ‚úÖ

1/24/2025

2/23 - 2/25

- Implement piece rotations ‚úÖ
- Make rotations always go clockwise ‚úÖ
- Perfect alignment with the grid with rotated shapes ‚úÖ

Goals for 2/25 - 2/28

- Implement a global variable for the sizeOfEachPiece dependent on the board size and screen size ‚úÖ

- Improve design for mobile devices

In General

Priority Fixes and Features

- When a piece is dragged across the board, make the transition time 0 so it doesn't appear to re-animate from it's original location after it's already been dragged away.
- Make the rotation appear to be about the origin, not re-rendering it at the top left of the original rectangle.
- Make the shift after a rotation that causes a piece to be un-aligned with the grid more graceful/animated.
- Make the original piece disappear as soon as it's being dragged in the air.
- Handle case where a rotation causes a piece to go partly off the board.
- Handle UX for a piece that is too tall or too long to fit on the board
- Detect and prevent/handle collisions between pieces.

Features to Add Later

- Add animation for collisions
- Add animations to reset function
- Deselect puzzle pieces on clickAway with a custom hook
- Add distributive property functionality
- Add a win screen/ message
- Add game instructions & rules
- Add something to hint to the user that they can click the pieces to see the possible actions.
- Add limits to the UI to show how many actions the user can use
- Add limits to the level json and import them through context

Much Later or Possibly not at all

- Set up system to allow for fractional side lengths
- Add sound effects for collisions and piece placements

Bugs to Fix

- When moving a piece with the spacebar and keyboard, and then pressing reset game, that piece stays on the board.
  - This appears to be fixed now although I'm not sure why. ‚úÖ
- Sometimes there is an empty border and it appears the actual piece is displaced but it's border is still there. Upon inspection of the CSS the motion.div from rectangle was mysteriously getting a transform3d style from somewhere(?) so I used !important to set transform3d to 0px in all directions as a temporary fix.
- Make button text not selectable
- When a piece is rotated and then dragged quickly, the rotating gets undone. Maybe disallow dragging until animation is complete? 
- Make the example piece in the instructions actually work with all the actions. 

Things to Figure Out

- Why does the puzzle piece rotate/rerender so much when I drag it?
- Can I prevent the re-rotating somehow? Yes! ‚úÖ
- How can I rotate a piece one time and then leave it rotated across multiple components acting as one? Answer: After the rotation animation, swap the width and the height and unrotate it in 0 seconds so it appears to still be rotated but acts like a normal puzzle piece with the width and height swapped.
- How should I implement the UI for distributive property operations?
- Is it okay to have PiecesInPlay context derived from CurrentLevelContext?
- Is it okay to have 3 different components all acting as puzzlePieces?
- How to make the initialPieces container a nice UX for when moving pieces into and out of it and changing the size of pieces? Let them constantly shift or allow overlap??
- How should I handle piece collisions in terms of UX?
- Why do the pieces animate into place when switching from level 1 to level 2 but not any other levels?
- Where is transform3d coming from on the rectangle pieces?
